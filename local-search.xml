    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/OSWE_badge.png" alt="OSWE Badge"></p><h2 id="What-is-the-AWAE"><a href="#What-is-the-AWAE" class="headerlink" title="What is the AWAE?"></a><strong>What is the AWAE?</strong></h2><p>Advanced Web Attacks and Exploitation is a course by OffSec to help you develop your exploitation skills in web application penetration testing. This is a course that heavily focuses on white box testing so if you are interested in improving your white box testing skills, this is the course for you. This is a advanced course so you are expected to be familiar with various web technologies as well as basic scripting skills. This is not a course for you to learn the various web vulnerabilities out there, there are many other alternatives like Portswigger Academy. So do check it out if your aim is to learn and be exposed to different types of web vulnerabilities.</p><h2 id="Why-did-I-take-the-AWAE"><a href="#Why-did-I-take-the-AWAE" class="headerlink" title="Why did I take the AWAE?"></a><strong>Why did I take the AWAE?</strong></h2><p>I took the AWAE as I wanted to improve my skills on exploiting vulnerabilities in web applications. I also wanted to learn how to do white box testing after learning it from a theortical perspective. Another factor that pulled me to take it was the appeal of the OSCE3 certification, tt seems like it is working on me :P.</p><h2 id="Course-Overview"><a href="#Course-Overview" class="headerlink" title="Course Overview"></a><strong>Course Overview</strong></h2><p>The course takes you through a series of case studies. In these case studies, you will learn various type of vulnerabilities and how they were discovered from a  white box tetsting point of view. It is very comprehensive as they guide you through these case studies step by step. From there, you would also learn how to create your exploitation script from scratch, this is mainly done in Python. </p><h2 id="Lab-Environment"><a href="#Lab-Environment" class="headerlink" title="Lab Environment"></a><strong>Lab Environment</strong></h2><p>The lab environment was great and stable. I didn‚Äôt have any issues with it. Each case studies have their own lab setup. There are also challenge labs where you could put the skills you have learnt throughout the course to the test. I really enjoyed doing the challenge labs as it allow me to see the bigger picture. There were some moments where I was very confused while going through the material but I only understood why it is taught in that way when I attempted to do the challenge labs.</p><h2 id="Exam"><a href="#Exam" class="headerlink" title="Exam"></a><strong>Exam</strong></h2><p>The exam is a <strong>48 Hour</strong> Practical Exam where you have to fulfill certain objectives. Passing it will grant you the OffSec Web Expert (OSWE) certification! While I can‚Äôt say much about the exam, what I can tell is that everything tested can be found within the course material. The exam is doable if you understood the vulnerabilities that were taught in the course. You would also need to learn how to chain vulnerabilities so always think about what is the vulnerability at hand and how it can lead you to fulfilling the exam objectives.</p><p>I reached passing score at around the 30 Hours mark!</p><p><img src="/images/OSWE_Cert.png" alt="OSWE Certificate"></p><h2 id="Pros-Cons"><a href="#Pros-Cons" class="headerlink" title="Pros &amp; Cons"></a><strong>Pros &amp; Cons</strong></h2><h3 id="‚úÖ-Pros"><a href="#‚úÖ-Pros" class="headerlink" title="‚úÖ Pros:"></a>‚úÖ <strong>Pros:</strong></h3><p>‚úî <strong>Excellenent Case Studies</strong> with each introducing a particular type of vulnerability.<br>‚úî <strong>Course taught with a focus on White Box Testing</strong><br>‚úî <strong>Learn how to chain various vulnerabilities together</strong> that can lead to authentication bypass or even Remote Code Execution.</p><h3 id="‚ùå-Cons"><a href="#‚ùå-Cons" class="headerlink" title="‚ùå Cons:"></a>‚ùå <strong>Cons:</strong></h3><p>‚úñ <strong>Pricey</strong>, 90 Days of Lab Access + 1 Exam Attempt cost around US$1749<br>‚úñ <strong>Not for learning the various typees  of web vulnerabilities</strong>, there are better resources such as Portswigger Academy.</p><h2 id="Should-I-take-AWAE"><a href="#Should-I-take-AWAE" class="headerlink" title="Should I take AWAE?"></a><strong>Should I take AWAE?</strong></h2><p>Take it if you see yourself doing white box testing or source code review. If you are more familiar with web application pentesting, then I would recommend taking it to challenge yourself! </p><h2 id="Is-the-OSCP-needed-to-take-this-course"><a href="#Is-the-OSCP-needed-to-take-this-course" class="headerlink" title="Is the OSCP needed to take this course?"></a><strong>Is the OSCP needed to take this course?</strong></h2><p>While the skills learnt in OSCP may help, I feel it is not necessary to take the OSCP before attempting the OSWE exam. With that being said, one should already be familiar with the common types of web vulnerability out there such as XSS, SQL Injection, LFI‚Ä¶</p><h2 id="Final-Verdict"><a href="#Final-Verdict" class="headerlink" title="Final Verdict"></a><strong>Final Verdict</strong></h2><p>üî• <strong>Rating: 8&#x2F;10</strong> üî•  </p>]]></content>

    <title>CRTO Cert Review</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/crto.png" alt="CRTO Certificate"></p><h2 id="What-is-CRTO"><a href="#What-is-CRTO" class="headerlink" title="What is CRTO?"></a><strong>What is CRTO?</strong></h2><p>The Certified Red Team Operator (CRTO) course by Zero Point Security is one of the most well-regarded training programs for red teaming, offering a hands-on and realistic experience in adversary simulation.</p><h2 id="Why-Did-I-take-CRTO"><a href="#Why-Did-I-take-CRTO" class="headerlink" title="Why Did I take CRTO?"></a><strong>Why Did I take CRTO?</strong></h2><p>I bought the course in preparation for OSEP but I did not touch it. One fine day during a school holiday, since I had already spent my own money to get the course, I thought I should complete it if not it will be a waste. Since my lab time had expired, I gotten 40 Hours of lab time. </p><h2 id="Course-Overview"><a href="#Course-Overview" class="headerlink" title="Course Overview"></a><strong>Course Overview</strong></h2><p>This course allow you to deepen your knowledge on <strong>red teaming, AD exploitation and post-exploitation techniques</strong>. The course focuses more on <strong>assumed breach scenario</strong> in order to focus more on the AD exploitation and post-exploitation techniques.</p><h2 id="Lab-Environment"><a href="#Lab-Environment" class="headerlink" title="Lab Environment"></a><strong>Lab Environment</strong></h2><p>The <strong>best part of CRTO is the lab environment</strong>, which is designed to be <strong>as close to a real enterprise setup as possible</strong>. It includes <strong>multiple Windows systems, Active Directory, and real-world misconfigurations</strong>, making it a fantastic playground for testing red team tactics. I got the 40 Hours package which I feel is more than enough to understand the concepts taught in the course.   </p><h2 id="Exam"><a href="#Exam" class="headerlink" title="Exam"></a><strong>Exam</strong></h2><p>The exam is a <strong>48 Hour</strong> Practical Exam where you have to compromise an AD environment and find <strong>8 flags</strong>. You only need <strong>6&#x2F;8 flags</strong> to pass and be certified. There is no need to write a report which is great! Personally, I didn‚Äôt take long to get the 6 flags but I took my own sweet time finding the last 2 flags. It was a fun and enjoyable exam. </p><h2 id="Pros-Cons"><a href="#Pros-Cons" class="headerlink" title="Pros &amp; Cons"></a><strong>Pros &amp; Cons</strong></h2><h3 id="‚úÖ-Pros"><a href="#‚úÖ-Pros" class="headerlink" title="‚úÖ Pros:"></a>‚úÖ <strong>Pros:</strong></h3><p>‚úî <strong>Realistic red team training</strong> with an enterprise AD environment.<br>‚úî <strong>Strong focus on Cobalt Strike</strong>, a widely used tool in red teaming.<br>‚úî <strong>No report writing for certification</strong>, making the exam purely technical.<br>‚úî <strong>Affordable compared to other offensive security courses</strong> like OSCP or CRTE.  </p><h3 id="‚ùå-Cons"><a href="#‚ùå-Cons" class="headerlink" title="‚ùå Cons:"></a>‚ùå <strong>Cons:</strong></h3><p>‚úñ <strong>Focuses mainly on Cobalt Strike</strong>, not as tool-agnostic<br>‚úñ <strong>Labs can be overwhelming for beginners</strong>, it is better to have some experience with AD before taking this course as it is more focused on the red teaming aspect rather than Windows AD. </p><h2 id="Should-I-take-CRTO"><a href="#Should-I-take-CRTO" class="headerlink" title="Should I take CRTO?"></a><strong>Should I take CRTO?</strong></h2><p>Absolutely, I had a blast taking it! Imo, the concepts and the labs were well put together. And of course, you get the chance to use Cobalt Strike and see how it is use for red teaming purposes. There is also a focus on OPSEC which allow you to think about OPSEC when you use certain methods, this is a quite a good way to intro the concept of red teaming and how it differs from pentesting. Also, it is more cheaper than generic pentesting certs like OSCP or CEH. </p><h2 id="Final-Verdict"><a href="#Final-Verdict" class="headerlink" title="Final Verdict"></a><strong>Final Verdict</strong></h2><p>CRTO is <strong>one of the best entry-level red teaming certifications</strong>, offering a <strong>realistic, hands-on, and well-structured learning experience</strong>. It‚Äôs <strong>highly recommended</strong> for penetration testers, red teamers, and security professionals who want to improve their <strong>Active Directory and C2 operation skills</strong>. If you‚Äôre aiming for <strong>real-world red team engagements</strong>, this certification is a great addition to your skillset.  </p><p>üî• <strong>Rating: 10&#x2F;10</strong> üî•  </p>]]></content>
