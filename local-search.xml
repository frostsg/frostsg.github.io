I decided to extend lab time and decided to complete the course and attempted the exam.</p><h2 id="What-is-CRTO"><a href="#What-is-CRTO" class="headerlink" title="What is CRTO?"></a>What is CRTO?</h2><p>CRTO is a certificate that is obtained by completing the Red Team Operator course by Zeropoint Security</p><h2 id="Should-I-take-CRTO"><a href="#Should-I-take-CRTO" class="headerlink" title="Should I take CRTO?"></a>Should I take CRTO?</h2><p>Absolutely, I had a blast taking it! Imo, the concepts and the labs were well put together. And of course, you get the chance to use Cobalt Strike and see how it is use for red teaming purposes. There is also a focus on OPSEC which allow you to think about OPSEC when you use certain methods, this is a quite a good way to intro the concept of red teaming and how it differs from pentesting.</p><p>testtest</p>]]></content>
